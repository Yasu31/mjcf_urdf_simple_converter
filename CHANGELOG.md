- Add OBJ mesh + MTL color export
    - instead of STLs, use a combination of OBJ + MTL to bake the color directly into the meshes
    - now different colors for each mesh in one link can be achieved 
    - Rviz cannot render different colors for each `<visual>` element in a single `<link>` when using `<material>` to set colors (known issue, still there in ROS 2- see [here](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/58836/color-issue-with-urdf-and-multiple-visual-tags) or [here](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/843)) so this approach was taken
